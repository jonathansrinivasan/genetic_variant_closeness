# Variant Closeness
How informative are variant clinical data and 3 dimensional protein-variant properties to understand rarely (or never) observed variants "close" in space.

# ACMG Classification Criteria
ACMG_BP4 (-1)- Multiple lines (>=5) of computational evidence support a benign effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.) - from dbNSFP. ACMG_PM1 (2) - Missense variant in a somatic mutation hotspot as determined by cancerhotspots.org. 

# Understanding the Significance of "Closeness"
Intuitively, structural information informs adjudication of variants, especially when variants fall within known, structured “hotspots”. There is a growing appreciation that structure affords an orthogonal basis for judging the impact of genetic variants, so much so that the ACMG suggests "mutation hotspot" be incorporated into variant classification (see above). We have previously shown certain functional perturbations of INa and IKs can be informed by a structural clustering or “functional density” metric using recently experimentally determined structures of homologous channels. Our objective in this aim is to formalize this intuition by quantitating variant “closeness” to other characterized variants through three-dimensional space and through concerted motion. We will generate dynamic and static structure-based predictive features derived from published homologous structures of the three ion channel complexes.
