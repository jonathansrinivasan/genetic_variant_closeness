Use only where total_carriers is more than zero

train on data with penetrance values
best leverage proximity or closeness

dont worry about gnomAD, gnomAD_seq

'lqt2_dist',
'lqt2_dist_weight'


maybe change target to: 'lqt2_penetranceBayesian_initial' (closer to the mean value),'lqt2_penetranceBayesian' 
everything without 'sequence' needs 'structure'

Which missing columns have the most missing values
Don't use columns that have weight

penetrance = (number of ppl with the variant and also have phenotype) / (total number of ppl with the variant)

lqt2 + unaff = total_carriers

use lqt2_dict_obs_seq




For Hist regressor:

Seems Good:
RMSF
lqt2_dist_max
revel_score

Seems not so good:
aasimilaritymat



For xgboost:

Seems Good:


Seems not so good:
lqt2_dist_obs_max


Look into:
Naive Bayes: A classification algorithm that is based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the 
presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.


between 2 residues = 4 monomers 

there are 4 residues for each, so that is why there is max and mean
revel score = insilico predictor 

change NAs in RMSF to the max value in the column
 




Remove NAs from these columns and try running em:

lqt2_dist_observed                 375
lqt2_dist_weight_observed          375
lqt2_dist_obs_max                  375
lqt2_dist_weight_obs_max           375
lqt2_dist_obs_mean                 375
lqt2_dist_weight_obs_mean          375
lqt2_dist_obs_seq                  375
lqt2_dist_weight_obs_seq           375
